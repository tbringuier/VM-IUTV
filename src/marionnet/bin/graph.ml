(** A general-purpose polymorphic graph data structure, written in imperative
    style.
    Nodes are identified by automatically-assigned unique ids, which are used
    also to recognize endpoints, for each edge.
    The implementation should be reasonably efficient, but remove_node can be
    optimized. remove_edge is difficult to make better because of a (gratuitous,
    in my opinion) restriction in Hashtbl: it's not allowed to remove a pair
    <key, value>, but only to blindly remove the "current" binding of key.
    So I have to get all bindings, filter them out, remove all bindings from the
    table, and reinsert the surviving ones. *)
